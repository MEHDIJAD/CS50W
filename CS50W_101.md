 ## Responsive Design
The practice of building a website so it adapts and looks good on any device (phone, tablet, or desktop) instead of having fixed sizes.
 * viewport
	The visible area of the user's screen. In code, it refers to this specific tag in the `<head>` which tells mobile browsers to render the page at the width of the screen, rather than shrinking a desktop view to fit:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
* Media Queries
	**Media Queries** A CSS feature that lets you apply specific styles only when certain conditions are met, like the screen width.

- _Example:_ "If the screen is smaller than 600px, make the background blue."
```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
    body { background-color: blue; }
}
```
* Flexbox
	**(Flexible Box Layout)** A CSS layout model (`display: flex;`) designed to arrange items in rows or columns efficiently. It automatically adjusts the space between and around items to fit the available space.
* Grids
  **CSS Grid** is a 2-dimensional layout system.
	- **What it does:** It lets you divide a page into both **rows** and **columns** at the same time (like a table or a spreadsheet).
	- **Key Difference:** While Flexbox is for 1D layouts (a single row **OR** a single column), Grid is for 2D layouts (rows **AND** columns).
